# Kata Containers Elections

This repository contains Kata Containers Elections reference documents
and tooling to run elections.

# Architecture Committee Elections

The Kata Architecture Committee is comprised of five seats, elected by the
eligible community, and one Committee Chair, selected by the five
Architecture Committee members.

## Election Dates

The Architecture Committee elections take place every six months, as
outlined in the
[Architecture Committee section](https://github.com/kata-containers/community#architecture-committee)
of the Community README.

The election process begins three calendar weeks prior to the election.
- One week for candidates to submit their candidacy
- One week "debate period" for electorate to pose questions on the community
mailing lists to learn the candidates platforms
- One week for voting
- Results announced

## Electorate

[Contributors](https://github.com/kata-containers/community#contributor)
(defined as anyone who has had code merged in the Kata Containers
project in the last 12 months) are eligible to vote in Architecture
Committee elections.

## Candidacy

Anyone who has made contributions to the Kata Containers project is eligible
to run. Candidates submit their candidacy by adding a text file to the
corresponding election folder under the community repo with their interest
and platform, and announcing their candidacy on the [community developer mailing
list](http://lists.katacontainers.io/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/kata-dev).

There are no term limits for Architecture Committee seats, but in order to
encourage diversity, no more than two of the five seats may be filled by
members with the same company affiliation. If a third member would be in
violation of the diverse affiliation rule, the seat is awarded to the next
highest scoring candidate who would not violate the rule. Members who change
affiliation between elections in a way that violates the diverse affiliation
rule are not required to relinquish their seat, however, the rule will
be enforced and applied in the following election.
