Background:

I’m one of the Kata Containers communities maintainer and active contributor since 2018, 
during the past few years, I developed the Kata Containers shimv2, which promoted Kata 
Containers from multi process model  into only two process(shimv2 and vmm) model, at the 
same time, it made  Kata Containers much more populated and adoptable in the k8s community.  
In addition, I’m the author of the rust version of the kata-agent, which bring Kata Containers 
from 1.0 to 2.0. Last but not lease, I’m the architecture and key developer of the rust version’s 
kata runtime, which had been opened and contributed to runtime-rs.  

In addition to that, I worked in Ant Group , which maintained the largest Kata Containers cluster, 
as an senior engineer, I’m responsible for the implementation and development of the kata container 
inside Ant, and I am confident that based on my development and land experience on the Ant Group, 
as well as the maintenance work of the community, I’d try my best to contribute much more to the 
Kata community.
