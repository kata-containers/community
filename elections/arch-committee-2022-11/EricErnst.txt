Background:

I am a software engineer at Apple, focused on cloud infrastructure, and I continue to be very invested in this project and have been engaged in the Kata community as a contributor and user.

Since the initial discussions of creating Kata started, I have been an active contributor and advocate for the project, both in code and in the greater Kata community/ecosystem. I am running again as I am very interested in this project's success in the ecosystem, and am very focused on making sure Kata continues to be a stable, production-ready solution for providing stronger container isolation.

Over the last year, I invested time ensuring that we have a solution for using virtio-blk for PVCs, ensuring we have overhead and sandbox sizing requirements available at Kata sandbox creation time, as well as introducing a method for setting IPtables in the guest to support virtual cluster use cases. One area I'm looking forward to driving this next year is finishing adding support for running shimv2 on Darwin.

We still have a lot of interesting work to do, and I look forward to continuing to contribute to the success of Kata Containers!
