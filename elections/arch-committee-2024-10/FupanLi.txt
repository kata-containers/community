Background:

I’m one of the Kata Containers communities maintainer and active contributor since 2018,
during the past few years, I developed the Kata Containers shimv2, which promoted Kata
Containers from multi process model  into only two process(shimv2 and vmm) model, at the
same time, it made  Kata Containers much more populated and adoptable in the k8s community.
In addition, I’m the author of the rust version of the kata-agent, which bring Kata Containers
from 1.0 to 2.0. Last but not lease, I’m the architecture and key developer of the rust version’s
kata runtime, which had been opened and contributed to runtime-rs.

I was elected as a Kata AC member last year and have served the Kata community for a year. During
this year, I actively promoted the maturity of Kata rust runtime and it has reached the requirements
of product-level stability.

In addition to that, I worked in Ant Group, which maintained the largest Kata Containers cluster,
as an senior engineer, I’m responsible for the implementation and development of the kata container
inside Ant, and I am confident that based on my development and land experience on the Ant Group,
as well as the maintenance work of the community, I’d try my best to contribute much more to the
Kata community.
