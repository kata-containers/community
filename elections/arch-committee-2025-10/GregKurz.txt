Background:

I am a Senior Software Engineer at Red Hat. I work for the Openshift
Sandboxed Containers project, which provides Kata Containers to the
Openshift Container Platform. I initially joined the effort to share my
expertise on system components involved in virtualization, most notably
QEMU, but my interest now spans the full stack, in order to provide a
well integrated and production grade software to end users.

I joined Kata Containers four years ago, as a developper first, but then
quickly endorsed the roles of reviewer, maintainer and I got directly
involved in several official releases. I've served on the Architecture
Committee for two years, helping with CI, releases and providing guidance
on good coding practices during reviews. I want to continue the effort and
help wherever I can.
