Background:

I'm a software engineer at Microsoft on the Azure Linux team, where my
focus is on growing Kata Containers as part of our cloud offering.

I've been serving on the AC for a year and I initially joined the
project around two years ago. Back then, I helped transition from
Jenkins to Github Actions to modernize the CI. Nowadays I'm involved in
both the Kata and CoCo communities, still improving and securing the CI,
and making various contributions across the codebase, as well as
triaging and reviewing external contributions.

Some highlights:
 - Led a mentorship program with five students from Boston University to
   develop a CI dashboard for Kata [1].
 - Secured $54K funding from Microsoft for CI resources in Azure as
   Microsoft sponsors a significant part of the CI architecture. Ongoing
   maintainership and monitoring of the sponsorship and spending.
 - Worked with Github to raise various Github Actions usage limits to
   significantly speed up CI and PR turnaround time, at no extra cost.
 - Various improvements and security/bug fixes.
