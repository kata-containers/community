# Architecture Committee Election Results: October 2025

Three nominations were received for the October 2025 elections:

- [`Aurelien Bombo`](https://github.com/sprt)
- [`Fupan Li`](https://github.com/lifupan)
- [`Greg Kurz`](https://github.com/gkurz)

Three seats were available, and the Architecture Committee resulting from
the above nominations would not contain more than two members of the
same affiliation, so the voting phase was skipped and all the nominated
individuals were appointed to the architecture committee.

Congratulations to our continuing members `Aurélien`, `Fupan` and `Greg`!
