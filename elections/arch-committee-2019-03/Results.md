# Architecture Committee Election Results: March 2019

Two nominations were received for the March 2019 elections:

- [Samuel Ortiz](https://github.com/sameo)
- [Xu Wang](https://github.com/gnawux)

As the number of applications matched the number of available seats, the
question and voting phases of the elections were bypassed, and the two
applicants were (re-)admitted to the Architecture Committee on 2019-02-19
for another 12 month term.
